# 2. Use commitlint

Date: 2021-05-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is
  a well-known standard for how teams should structure their commit-messages.
  
  *from the Conventional Commit site*:

  > The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention
  > on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating
  > an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on
  > top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features,
  > fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is
  a tool for enforcing commit messages
  
  *from the `commitlin` github repo*:

  > commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.

## Decision

- We will use `conventional-commits` in this project.
- We will enforce `conventional-commits` through `commitlint`
- We will enforce `conventional-commits` in PRs through a `Github action`.

## Consequences

### What becomes easier

- Using an automated tools for releases. e.g.: [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- Keeping a uniform format for commit messages
- Reviewing PRs, because reviewers will not need to worry about also reviewing
  commit message format.

### What becomes more difficult

- Pushing quick (wip) commits to a pull request will be more difficult
  as contributors will get need to know to use the right format.

### Risks introduced and mitigation
